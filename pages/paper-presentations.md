During the week of classes on Oct 31 and Nov 2, pairs of students will present a paper with a categorical data analysis to the rest of the class. Each group of students will have 25 minutes to present the paper. This assignment will count as a homework assignment and will be graded on the same scale (0, 5, or 10 points). Both members from the team will receive the same grade. Students will work in pairs to be assigned by the instructor. Your paper choice must be posted on the `#paper-presentation` slack channel by 1pm Tuesday, October 24.

The presentation must include:

 - an introduction to the scientific question of the paper
 - a description of the data, with accompanying notation 
 - a description of the methodology used (note: depending on how methodological the paper is, this might involve presenting more details on the methodology than is in the paper itself. E.g. if the paper presents a matched pairs analysis, it might not describe the details of the methodology. You should.)
 - a description of the results (including tables and figures from the original paper, as necessary)
 - questions you had about the methodology or results after reading the paper
 - if the data is available for the analysis, were you able to reproduce the results?
