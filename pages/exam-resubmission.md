#### Midterm Exam

If you wish, you may resubmit the midterm exam to boost your original exam grade. I will regrade the exam upon resubmission and average the two grades together to calculate the exam grade that will go in the grade book.

Here are the guidelines:

 - Once the exam is handed back, you may not consult with any human about the exam.
 - You may, however, use books and existing resources on the internet to help you approach solutions. Posting exam questions on internet forums with a request for assistance is not permitted.
 - The assignment should be typed up, as other lab assignments have been, and both the source file and PDF should be submitted via Google Drive by 5pm on Tuesday, November 21.
 - There are 10 "extra credit" points on the exam. The first 5 points are question 3e. The second five are from 4b (the part about the interpretation of the age coefficient). These two questions are trickier and less straight-forward than I had intended. Therefore, both the first and second round scores for the exam will be calculated out of a total of 90 possible points. However, if you answer these questions correctly (or get partial credit), your total number of points could be as high as 100.
