#### Course summary
This course provides an overview of statistical methods for analyzing data where the outcome variable is categorical or discrete. The course will emphasize the theoretical underpinnings of the methods as well as an applied understanding of the computation and interpretation, both of which are necessary to succeed with real data analysis. We will cover inference for binomial and multinomial variables with contingency tables, generalized linear models, logistic regression for binary responses, logit models for multiple response categories, log-linear models, some statistical machine learning approaches, inference for matched-pairs, and correlated/clustered data. Examples will be taken from public health and biomedical research. Students will be evaluated on homework assignments, a mid-term exam and a final project.
